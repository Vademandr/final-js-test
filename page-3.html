            <h3>Quote of the day</h3>
            <p>
              A lot of times I find that people who are blessed with the most
              talent don't ever develop that attitude, and the ones who aren't
              blessed in that way are the most competitive and have the biggest
              heart.

            <h3>110 min</h3>
            <p>Daily norm of sports</p>
            <p>
              The World Health Organization recommends at least 150 minutes of
              moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity throughout the week
              for adults aged 18-64. However, what happens if we adjust that
              number to 110 minutes every day? While it might seem like a high
              number to hit, dedicating 110 minutes daily to sporting activities
              may offer unparalleled benefits to physical health, mental
              well-being, and overall quality of life.
